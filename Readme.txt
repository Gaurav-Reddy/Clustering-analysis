1. The list of the libraries that are needed are.
Kneed 
Tensorflow
Keras
Sklearn
tensorflow
matplotlib.pyplot
pandas
numpy

To install the needed package in the commmand prompt or Terminal type 'pip install [package name]'

2. Before running this program you must change the path to the input file ie the path to the dataset

3. the elbow point detection is still little iffy the kneed package is realtively new and I have not hard coded any thing to this data set.

4. the out put of the auto encoder is a .csv file with 3 features (the code may run slow (15-20 seconds) as i have used tensorflow).
